# Let's Pray Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 28, 2026

## Overview
Let's Pray ("the App") is a desktop prayer-times utility. We designed it to work with minimal data collection and without creating user accounts.

## Data We Process

### 1) Location Data (Optional)
The App may use your location to calculate prayer times.
- Automatic detection can use device geolocation (if you allow it) and/or IP-based location providers.
- You can also choose a city manually.
- Location is stored locally on your device in app settings.

### 2) App Settings (Local Only)
The App stores preferences locally, such as:
- language
- theme
- calculation method
- madhab
- prayer offsets
- notification and audio preferences

These settings are saved on your device and are not sent to our servers.

### 3) Network Requests
The App may call third-party services for:
- reverse geocoding / location lookup
- checking for new app releases on GitHub

These requests are required to provide app features (location detection and update awareness).

## What We Do Not Collect
- No account registration
- No passwords
- No payment data
- No direct personal profile database hosted by us

## Data Sharing
We do not sell your personal data.  
Data may be transmitted to third-party APIs only when required by app functionality (for example, location lookup and update checks).

## Children
The App is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect sensitive personal data from children.

## Security
We take reasonable measures to limit data processing and keep app data local whenever possible. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Your Choices
- You can disable automatic location detection.
- You can set location manually.
- You can disable notifications/audio features.
